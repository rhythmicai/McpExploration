# A Brief History of AI + Dev

## Pre-2020: AI Curiosity Phase
- Mostly autocomplete
- Not much in production
- `IntelliCode`, `Kite`

# A Brief History of AI + Dev

## 2021: Copilot enters
- We probably all tried it, 
- most of us "real devs" hated it

# A Brief History of AI + Dev

## 2022-2023: Ecosystem Explosion
- ` Cursor `, ` WindSurf `, ` ChatGPT `
- Some real people started using it
- Still not great, but definitely better

# A Brief History of AI + Dev

## 2024+: Enter the Vibe Coder + Agentic Dev

- Some definite possibility
- Great for proof of concepts
- When used right can accelerate, __not replace__ developers

# What AI CAN do.
Be a radical pragmatist

- Autocomplete boilerplate, tests, regex, data access code
- Refactor with scary confidence
- Translate old frameworks (e.g., .NET Framework ‚ûù Core)
- Save minutes per task, which stacks into hours

# What AI CAN'T do.
Be a radical pragmatist

- Understand business logic deeply
- Replace architecture decisions
- Replace humans on high-context debugging or legacy migration
- Fix the spaghetti it just wrote yesterday

# Let's start with out-of-the-box Github Copilot
It's gotten better and can do some impressive stuff. But, woa boy can it get it wrong.

```md
Generate a form using PrimeVue's form. The form should have name, user name, 
email, phone, and address. The form should submit to the database.
```

# Prompting can make it smarter
Prompt engineering...the "science" of arguing with a computer and forcing it to do what you want...kinda.... ever argued with a computer? __Well now you get to.__

````md magic-move
```md
Generate a form using PrimeVue's form. The form should have name, user name, 
email, phone, and address. The form should submit to the database.
```
```md
Your goal is to generate a new Vue form component.

The form should have name, user name, 
email, phone, and address. The form should submit to the database.

Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

Requirements for the form:

- Use form design system guidelines: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
- Always define TypeScript types for your form data
- Use `zod` for validation:
  - Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
  - Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
  - Customize UX-friendly validation Rules
- Use PrimeVue components for the UI

```

It's like a sitemap for your documentation. It is a standard way of storing a site informaiton in a way you can easily find it and a format you can easily consume.

We use Nuxt 3, Vue, Tailwind, Prisma, and Zenstack as our typical stack. When using Vue, we use the composition API, so always use that when creating vue code.

for ANY question about LangGraph or PrimeVue, Mud Blazor, use #list_doc_sources and #fetch_docs to help answer. reflect on the urls in the llms.txt, reflect on the input question, call fetch_docs on any urls relevant to the questions
